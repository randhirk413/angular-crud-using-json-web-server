## Installation
### To create an Angular project, you can follow these steps:
1. Install Node.js and npm: If you don't have Node.js and npm installed on your machine, download and install them from the official Node.js website.
2. Install Angular CLI: Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally on your system:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
3. Create a new Angular project: Once the Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    ng new your-project-name
    ```
   Replace "project-name" with the name you want to give your project.
4. Navigate to your project directory: Use the cd command to navigate into your new project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```
5. Run the development server: To see your Angular project in action, run the following command:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
This will start a development server and your application will be available at http://localhost:4200/.
